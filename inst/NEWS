-------------------------

New Functions:

- New available.data.types() functon to check all the cancer studies from
  cbioportal.org to examine whether or not they contain RNA-seq, microRNA-seq,
  microarray(mRNA), microarray(miRNA) and methylation data.


- New process.multiple.studies() function to Obtain the requested data for
  the given genes across multiple cancer studies. It can check whether or not
  all genes are included in cancer studies and, if not, looks for the alternative
  gene names. Tha main part of function calculates frequency percentage, frequency
  ratio, mean expression and median of samples greather than specific value in the
  selected cancer studiess. Furthermore, it looks for the genes that comprise the
  highest values in each cancer study.

- New process.one.study() functions to Obtain the requested data for the given
  genes across multiple subgroups of a cancer. It can check whether or not all
  genes are included in subgroups of a cancer study and, if not, looks for the
  alternative gene names. The main part of function calculates frequency percentage,
  frequency ratio, mean expression and median of samples greather than specific value
  in the selected subgroups of the cancer. Furthermore, it looks for the genes that
  comprise the highest values in each cancer subgroup.
